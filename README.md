Intro
=====

This R package was built in STAT545 at UBC, and is intended for teaching/learning purposes only

Install
=======

This R package can be installed from github:

-   Note I haven't pushed the final version yet; will update README when I push the final version

``` r
#install.package("devtools")
devtools::install_github("margotgunning/powers")
```

    ## Downloading GitHub repo margotgunning/powers@master
    ## from URL https://api.github.com/repos/margotgunning/powers/zipball/master

    ## Installation failed: Not Found (404)

Here's a short example
======================

This can also be seen in the vignette, which I also haven't finished yet

``` r
powers::square(2)
```

    ## [1] 4

``` r
#>[1] 4
```

For development
===============

Not much to say here because this is a learning tool.

There is an internal function called pow that is the machinery for the sqaure function, and functions yet to come ie) cube
# powers
