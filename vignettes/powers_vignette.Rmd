# Intro

This R package was built in STAT545 at UBC, and is intended for teaching/learning purposes only

The main goal of this R package is to compute powers without having to use ```^``` or ```**```

# Example execution

```{r}
library(powers)
square(2)
#cube(3)
```

## We can apply powers in lists of vectors too!

```{r}
listy_list <- list(4,2,9,0.2,-0.8,-0.4)
lapply(listy_list, square)
```

And That's All Folks
